# UESTC-Master-s-Thesis-Overleaf-Latex-Version-for-International-Students
This is the Overleaf Latex version of UESTC Master's Thesis for International postgraduate students who wish to format their postgraduate thesis using overleaf latex template rather than word template which comes with so much challenges.

# Short brief
UESTC Thesis in overleaf latex version for master's International Students. The UESTC Thesis overleaf version available to postgraduate International Students has been repeatedly reported to have some bugs by the students and which makes it difficult for international students to cope with the required format. Issues like wrong page numbering, interference between roman and arabic numbering, inconsistent page header and unnecessary blank pages. In this repository, I have addressed all those bugs, and re-organized the UESTC Thesis overleaf latex version to suit the requirement for master's thesis format.
